# 🍕 jwt-pizza-service

![Coverage badge](https://badge.cs329.click/badge/accountId/jwtpizzaservicecoverage)

Backend service for making JWT pizzas. This service tracks users and franchises and orders pizzas. All order requests are passed to the JWT Pizza Factory where the pizzas are made.

JWTs are used for authentication objects.

## Deployment

In order for the server to work correctly it must be configured by providing a `config.js` file.

```js
export default {
  jwtSecret: 'your-cryptographically-generated-secret-here',
  db: {
    connection: {
      host: 'localhost',
      user: 'root',
      password: 'your-secure-database-password-here',
      database: 'pizza',
      connectTimeout: 60000,
    },
    listPerPage: 10,
  },
  factory: {
    url: 'https://pizza-factory.cs329.click',
    apiKey: 'your-factory-issued-api-key-here',
  },
};
```

## Endpoints

You can get the documentation for all endpoints by making the following request.

```sh
curl localhost:3000/api/docs
```

## Development notes
